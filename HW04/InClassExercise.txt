I could get the program to run, but the output was nothing but blue pixels.
I later tried to fix my program, but could not find the error.
The output (including the runtimes) are in the mandelbrot.pbs.o* file in this folder.
Because of how unusual the runtimes are, and the fact that this program does not run correctly,
I have not included a graph of my results.
